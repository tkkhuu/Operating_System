Test cases with chef_cond.c
Change global variable RANDOM to 1. It allows to generate an order between 0 - 1 second.
Change global variable RANDOM to 0. It closes the random time delay between each orders. So all the order arrives together.
Change global variable N. This is number of total orders.

We test the program with RANDOM to 0, N to 30; corresponding to the file output_cond1.txt.
We test the program with RANDOM to 1, N to 30; corresponding to the file output_cond2.txt.



Test cases with chef_sem.c

Change global variable RANDOM to 1. It allows to generate an order between 0 - 1 second.
Change global variable RANDOM to 0. It closes the random time delay between each orders. So all the order arrives together.
Change global define variable N. This is number of total orders.

We test the program with RANDOM to 0, N to 30; corresponding to the file output_sem1.txt.
We test the program with RANDOM to 1, N to 30; corresponding to the file output_sem2.txt.
