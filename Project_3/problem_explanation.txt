=================== Semaphore solution  ===================
In order to simulate a chef working in the kitchen, we design each chef to have 3 state:
Enter station: the state when a chef is about to enter the next station
Perform: The state when a chef is perform the current step of the recipe that he is working on
Leave station: The state when a chef is about to leave his current position

Before a chef enters a station, he needs to check whether the next station is available, if not, wait
After he makes sure that the next station is available, he must make the current station available for other chef

We therefore have the following global variables: list of orders, states of each chef, a cursor to get the next order on the list.

For each global variable, we create a semaphore: 
- a semaphore to control list of orders, 
- 3 semaphores to control each state of each chef, 
- the cursor will associate with the list of order so it does not need its own semaphore, 
- and 4 semaphore for 4 stations

We create a struct to represent a step of a recipe, each step contains the station and the time period that the chef needs to spend at this station

Then we create a struct to represent an order, each order has:
- a recipe name
- A list of steps
- a cursor to keep track of the current step
- a flag to determine whether this order is done 
- a value to determine the number of step

We create a function that can randomly generate orders from the 5 given recipes.

Questions:
- In what cases can a deadlock occur? Is there a reliable way to predict a deadlock in advance and avoid
such scenarios?
- What is the most fair way to avoid starvation? In what cases is it reasonable to sacrifice perfor-
mance/parallelism to avoid starvation?

Answers: 
- A situation when deadlock happens is when 3 chefs are waiting to enter each other's part of the kitchen. 
  For example chef 1 in stove, chef 2 in oven and chef 3 in sink.
  Chef 1 is waiting to enter oven, chef 2 is waiting to enter sink and chef 3 is waiting to enter stove.
  One way to avoid deadlock is that if it happens, we can drop one of the chefs with his current order to allow the other chef to continue.
  The droped order will be re-added to the queue to be processed. 
  
- The most fairway to avoid starvation if to give a waiting the priority to go first if he has been waiting for more than a value of time.
- It is reasonable when an order has to be done after it has been waiting for too long, we want to satisfy the customer as well.
